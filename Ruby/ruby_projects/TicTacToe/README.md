# Tic-Tac-Toe Project
## -- TheOdinProject --

Here's where I'm essentially going to map out what I'm thinking for the design
I just went over a class/module/object review and it seems like that's what is prompted

I'm thinking there's going to be
an object for each X or O
and object for the game board
maybe the gameboard object handles the game logic

Maybe the game loop uses a boolean to control p1/p2
a list of possible winning combos that is checked to see if there is a winner

maybe the module can handle game logic or structure
like a checking module that automatically keeps track of which spaces are open
so that in the game loop, there's a reference that can be output to console easly
